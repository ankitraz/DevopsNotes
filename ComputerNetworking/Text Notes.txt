What is Network?
- computers connected together

How did it start ?
- ARPA -> Advanced Reserch Projects Agency

Protocol - The rules that are set up by people how a particular data is
           being send. eg - tcp,ip,udp

WWW - it's an information system where documents and other web resourches
       are identified by URLs, which may be interlinked by hyperlinks

INTERNET society are responsible for creating these protocols

* Client - Server Architecture
-> in this, client request the data from the server and server reponds back to it

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOME BASIC PROTOCOLS
1. TCP - Transmission Control Protocol -
        - ensure that data will reach its destination and not get corrupted

2. UDP - User Datagram Protocol
       - when you don't care about if 100% of teh data is reaching to its destination.

3. HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
        - used by Web Browsers
        - data that is being transferred between clients and servers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Every single device on the internet that can talk to each other, the
 have some kind of unique address, knows as IP Address.
            format - x.x.x.x   *each x is between 0-25.

1. Global ip Address and Local ip Address
-> Modem/ router provides the local ip address through DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocols)
-> Modem/ router will decied who requested it. it does that using NAT(network Access Translator)
-> Ip address decides which device to send the data whereas PORT numbers
    are used to identify whic application made that request.
-> Ports are 16bit numbers
1. 0-1023 => reserved ports
2. 1024-49152 => registered for applications
3. remainig for our use.

LOCAL AREA NETWORK - Interconnects computer within limited area such as
                     residence, school, university camput. ethernet, wifi

METROPOLITIAN AREA NETWORK -  interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a cities

WIDE AREA NETWORK - Extends over large geographic area (countries)
