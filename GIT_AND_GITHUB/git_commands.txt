git status - to check the status of our repo // these are the guest whose photos has not been taken yet.

git add . or git add (individual file names) - to put all the files in staging area.
. means everything in current project directory

git restore -- stagged file.txt - to unstage a file

git commit -m " your message" - to commit a changes


git log - to check all the history of commits


how to go to a particular commit
copy the commit id
git reset commit_id --- to go back to previous commit

git stash - to send to backstage
git stash pop - to call that backstagged commits
git stash clear - to remove backstage commits

how to attach a project from github to local git project
git remote add origin url_of_repo
git remote -v -- this will show all the url attached to the folder of git
git remote remove origin

// delete branch locally
git branch -d localBranchName

// delete branch remotely
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName


git push origin master - to push changes to github from git
Git pull origin master â€“ to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately
                          update the local repository to match that content.

we should never commit on main branch directly
create a seperate branch and the pull request


git branch name_of_branch --- to create a new branch
git checkout name_of_branch --- to move the head to thaat particular branch
git merge name_of_branch ---- to merge that branch to main branch on github

// working with existing project on github

git clone url_of_your_forked_repo -----to download that repo folder

upstream url - from where you have forked that repo is known as upstream url

git remote add upstream url_of _repo --- to add the upstream repo to your git

git push origin name_of-brach -f - - to force push the commit

to fetch upstream - use
git fetch --all --prune (prune means deleted changes also)
then
git checkout main - swith to main first
and then
git reset --hard upstream/main --- to update the main branch or our cloned repo from upstream repo..

and then your local main branch will be up to date with upstream main
now, just push all the comit to gitub and you gitub cloned repo will all be up to dated with main branch of upstrem repo


// we can also do like
git pull upstream main ---- just a single code to fetch local main branch with upstream
git push orgin main --- to push it to main branch of github repo




// merge conflicts
if you have so many commits and you want to merge them all into one then do this
